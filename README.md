# coin_probabilities
Various probabilities of situations occurring with coin flips.

1. Returns a list of the run lengths in n tosses of a coin whose heads probability is p.
2. Draws a histogram of the maximum run length in n tosses of a coin with a heads probability p.
3. Draws a histogram of the number of runs in n tosses of a coin with a heads probability p.



You flip a fair coin three times. Each flip is independent of the other flips. This program determines the probability of each event described below. (number correlates to function)

The three flips have identical outcomes.
Exactly two flips have identical outcomes.
Exactly two consecutive flips have identical outcomes.
The sequence of flips consists of two heads and one tail.
The sequence of flips results in at least as many heads as tails.
Every flip has an outcome different from that of the flip immediately preceding it (except the first flip, which has no preceding flip).
